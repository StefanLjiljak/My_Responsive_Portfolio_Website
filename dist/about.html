                <p>In May 2018 , after several months of talking, consultations and advising from a couple of my close
                    IT friends I decided to quit and resign at that time my current job and enter the world of web
                    development. Since then I am learning highly motivated almost every day to acquire
                    interdisciplinary knowledge that connects law and the IT sector. I even didn't go to the
                    seaside holiday that year in order to save up some extra time and finances for the learning period
                    in the future, and it's already paying off.</p>
